Supervised Learning : It is basicallly a type of machine Learning in which we know about the pattern
of input and output data.

Steps for build a Supervised ML Model:
1. Find data source.
2. Data loading and cleaning.
     a)  It includes taking care of null data
     b) converting data from one form to another
     c) dividing the data in training and testing sets.
3. Pick an algorithm
4. Train the algorithm
5. Test the algorithm
6. If algorithm not works well try again above steps with different algorithm.
